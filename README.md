Project Title: Multi-Email Manager Tool

Project Background and Description:
Email messaging is a widely spammed form of communication. These spam messages not only waste our time but can contain dangerous phishing and malware attacks. Considering that email technology currently connects over 2.5 billion people world-wide (Radicati Group Inc., 2015) this is a serious issue. I propose to create a client/server email service that would manage a collection of automatically generated, single use email addresses to give users more control over their contacts. This system would quickly be able to identify from which contact a piece of spam originated, flag the contact and isolate/prevent/remove all unwanted messages. This service would also prevent the use of email addresses for online profiling.

Project Aim: 
To create a client/server email service that gives users more control over their point of contact.
Project Objectives:
•	Give user control over their point of contact.
•	Setup a secure client/server email system.
•	Create an email generation tool.
•	Learn/Improve on my professional/technical skills.
•	Start a portfolio of work to demonstrate these skills. 
•	Achieve high grades.

Project Deliverables:
Must           - Generate a new email address for each new contact.
               - Allow users to delete contacts (by deleting relative email addresses).
               - Provide basic emailing sending/receiving services.
Should         - Store contact details (linked to the corresponding email address).
               - Combine all user email addresses into a single inbox.
               - Allow users to flag spamming sites to other users.
Could          - Auto fill newly generated email address into online forms. 
               - Provide more extensive email services.
               - Be hosted on a cloud environment.
